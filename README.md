# Building Simple UI Components

## What to Expect from this Personal Mini Project?

1. Get better understanding of how tailwindCSS works.
2. By combining tailwindCSS with React, more convenient process of building ui components is expected.
3. Most importantly, wake up your CSS SPIRIT!!

## Tools used.

1. React.js: v18.2.0
2. Tailwindcss: v3.1.8

## I Learned...

1. that the tailwindcss ^3.0.0 works differently from the former versions. It used to start with chubby file and purged properties that were not in use. Heavy file and inefficiency. However, after upgrade, it starts with empty(default) file and adds newly generated classes to the list. CLASS CAN BE GENERATED ON DEMAND. isn't it amazing?

2. that tailwindcss way of designing components can lead me to create user-friendly UI. It is very convenient and easy to learn.

3. that last but not least, learning new things take time and it is worth it. Let's not hesitate to learn new library tools which can boost your development experience.
